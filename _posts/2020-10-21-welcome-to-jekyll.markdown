I am a Research Associate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Luxembourg where I work on development and evaluation of conversational agents. <br> 
Specifically, my current research focuses on assessment of cognitive and usability implications of interfaces that feature speech, and exploration of their potential to inspire positive behavioural change in users.
